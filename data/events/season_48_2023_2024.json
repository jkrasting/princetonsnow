With sufficient cold air in place the precipitation started as snow in the GFDL/Princeton but the snow changed to rain during the afternoon of Jan 6 as the circulation around the deepening storm brought more warm air into our area.",

The storm produced a powdery snow to the north and a particularly heavy snow band developed well north of the center over Upper Bucks in PA and across Hunterdon, Somerset and parts of Middlesex counties in NJ. This produced significant variability of snowfall amounts across the greater Princeton region. (It should be noted that GFDL's C-Shield model run at 00Z Feb 17 did a good job at capturing this very heavy snow band for early AM Feb 17.)",
